# Russian-Interbank-Network-Structure-and-its-Determinants
Bachlor thesis at University College Roosevelt

This paper uses daily data on the Russian interbank exposures collected between August
1998 and November 2004 to study the topology of the network. Specifically, three
centrality measures are analyzed: degree, betweenness, and harmonic closeness centrality.
First, the paper documents that those measures exhibit substantial variation. All of
them at least tripled in their value over the studied timespan, showing great increase of
the interbank activities. In addition, all three measures display greater volatility during
crisis periods compared to non-crisis. Second, this study examines two potential determinants
of the network structure: oil price and seasonality. Regression results illustrate
that the former does not affect the network structure, while the latter does. In particular,
monthly dummy variables for May and December show significant effect, indicating
seasonal patterns before the summer and Christmas holidays.

Codes for calculating the measures are included, as well as the entire report.
